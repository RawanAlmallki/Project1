# Project1: Traffic accidents & driving licenses in KSA
## Problem statement:
The Traffic Department of the Ministry of Interior faced a problem in increasing traffic accidents in 2016-2017 and the average rate of traffic accidents in Saudi Arabia was up to (41029-35422) and there are regions in Saudi Arabia that exceed this average and have increased the level of damage caused by accidents.
## Summary:
We find two issues in the data that should be the main focus of the General Department of traffic going forward:

- While traffic accidents in most regions are relatively similar, three areas have far above the mean traffic accidents: Makkah, Riyadh and the Eastern Region.

- The Traffic Department of the Ministry of Interior should focus on the regions mentioned in the previous point, which have a high population density.
##  Dictionary:

|**latitude**|float|ksa_traff_accid,ksa_driv_lic|The latitude coordinate of the associated region.|
|**longitude**|float|ksa_traff_accid,ksa_driv_lic|The longitude coordinate of the associated region.|

## Conclusions & Recommendations:
### Conclusions:
- This report was created to help identify the causes of the increase in traffic accidents and how to find solutions to facilitate road traffic in Saudi Arabia. The data analyzed showed that the trend was to reduce the number of traffic accidents.
 During the years (2016-2017), data from the Traffic Department of the Ministry of Interior showed an increase in the main regions of Makkah, Riyadh and the Eastern region above the mean number of accidents. 

### Recommendations:
- You have to be careful and focus when driving in the major regions of Saudi Arabia. Accidents show much higher than the mean number of accidents in these regions.

- The traffic department should conduct more scrutiny and develop plans for the most densely populated regions.
